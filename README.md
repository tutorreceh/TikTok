For this script you will need the Report URL. 
To get it go and watch the tutorial on my YT

I also reccomend to use a vpn cause its possible that you will get IP banned

Quick note: this isnt gonna 100% ban the victim, it just increase the probability.

To install this:

On LINUX

git clone https://github.com/Mon0goescrazy/TTReport/

cd TTReport

pip3 install requests

pip3 install time

python3 TTReport.py
